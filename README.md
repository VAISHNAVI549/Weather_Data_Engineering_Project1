                                              Weather Data Engineering Project

This project demonstrates a complete data engineering pipeline that extracts weather data from API, transforms it, loads it, and visualizes it using an interactive dashboard.

So, Imagine you want to check the temperature and humidity of cities like New York, Orlando, and Austin, but instead of manually opening weather websites, you want a system that:

📡 Automatically collects weather data,

🧹 Cleans and organizes that data,

🗂️ Stores it neatly, and

📊 Shows it beautifully on a dashboard.

That’s exactly what this project does.


What Is This Project Doing?


This project follows the ETL process:

Extract – Get the weather data from an online source (like OpenWeather API).

Transform – Clean and format the data so it makes sense and is usable.

Load – Save it in a file or database.

Visualize – Display the data in charts that anyone can understand.



I used some basic Python Scripts for ETL Pipelines, PostgreSQL for database, basic HTML, CSS Styling scripts, Pandas, Flask.


🧑‍💼 Why This Project Matters

✅ Automated: No need to manually collect or update data

✅ Visual: Easy-to-understand charts for decision-makers

✅ Extendable: Can be used for other kinds of data too (stock market, pollution, etc.)

✅ Beginner-Friendly: Combines real-world tools in a practical and simple way
